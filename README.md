# pylib
A python utility library

This library contains some general utility functions I have found useful and find myself re-implementing every time I move to a new codebase.

Some effort has been made to make these modules compatible with python 2 and 3, simply because I still myself occasionally in an environment where users (still) have only python 2.7 installed. These users just want the script to work, and care not what runtime is in use, and care even less to install a full python distribution on an almost antique OS....
